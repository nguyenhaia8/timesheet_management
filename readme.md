## 1. Problem Description

The Timesheet Management System is designed to address the need for efficient, accurate, and user-friendly tracking of employee work hours within a current-week-only scope. It enables employees to create tasks linked to predefined projects, log daily work hours, and submit weekly timesheets for managerial approval. Managers can view, approve, or reject submissions from their direct reports, ensuring accountability and oversight. The system enforces critical business rules such as role-based access, daily hour limits, and real-time total calculations, streamlining the approval workflow and laying a scalable foundation for future enhancements like historical tracking, advanced reporting, and cross-team functionality.

---

## 2. User Stories

Describe the system from the user's perspective using user stories:

- As an **[Employee]**, I want to **[create a task]** for a given week so that my work hours are recorded and can be approved by my manager
- As an **[Employee]**, I want to **[edit my task]** edit my timesheet before it is approved so that I can correct any mistakes.
- As a **[Manager]**, I want to **[approve or reject]** submitted tasks so that only valid work hours are recorded.
- As a **[Manager]**, I want to  **[view all timesheets]** submitted by my team so that I can monitor their work hours.



---

## 3. Functional Requirements

List the system's essential features and functionalities:

- Employees can create timesheet.
- Employees can create weekly tasks
- Employees able to view their task.
- Managers able to view all timesheets submitted by their team.
- Managers able to approve or reject submitted timesheets.
- The system must record the approval status and comments for each timesheet.
---

## 4.  Non-Functional Requirements

- **Maintainability:**
  - The codebase should follow clean code principles and be well-documented.
  - The system should be modular, allowing for easy updates and bug fixes.

- **Usability:**
  - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for all user roles.
  - The system should provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., successful submission, errors).

## 5. Architecture of Project

### 5.1 Overview

Our system follows a **4-layer N-tier architecture** using modern Java Spring Boot practices:

1. **Presentation Layer (Controller)**  
   - Exposes RESTful APIs for all business entities (Employee, Department, Project, Task, Timesheet, Approval, etc.).
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses, input validation, and error handling.
   - Example: `EmployeeController`, `TaskController`, etc.

2. **Service Layer**  
   - Contains business logic and orchestrates data flow between controllers and repositories.
   - Handles validation, calculations (e.g., total work hours), and business rules.
   - Example: `EmployeeServiceImpl`, `TaskServiceImpl`, etc.

3. **Data Access Layer (Repository/DAO)**  
   - Uses Spring Data JPA repositories to abstract and manage all database operations.
   - Provides CRUD and custom query methods for each entity.
   - Example: `EmployeeRepository`, `TaskRepository`, etc.

4. **Database Layer**  
   - MySQL database stores all persistent data, including employees, timesheets, tasks, approvals, and more.
   - Enforces referential integrity and supports transactional operations.

This separation ensures modularity, testability, and maintainability.

### 8.1 Class Diagram Description

The class diagram represents the complete data model of the TimeSheet Management System with the following key components:

#### **Core Entity Classes:**
- **Employee**: Represents system users with personal information and organizational relationships
- **Department**: Organizational units that contain employees
- **Project**: Work initiatives managed by employees and owned by clients
- **Client**: External organizations that own projects
- **TimeSheet**: Weekly work hour records submitted by employees
- **TimeSheetEntry**: Individual daily work entries within a timesheet
- **Approval**: Managerial review records for timesheet submissions
- **User**: Authentication and authorization entities linked to employees
- **Role**: System roles defining user permissions
- **UserRole**: Many-to-many relationship between users and roles
- **EmployeeProject**: Many-to-many relationship between employees and projects

#### **Key Relationships:**
- **Employee Hierarchy**: Self-referencing relationship for manager-subordinate structure
- **Organizational Structure**: Department contains employees, with one employee as department head
- **Project Management**: Projects belong to clients and are managed by employees
- **Timesheet Workflow**: Employees create timesheets with entries, which go through approval process
- **User Authentication**: Users are linked to employees and have assigned roles
- **Project Assignment**: Employees can be assigned to multiple projects with specific roles

#### **Enumerations:**
- **ProjectStatus**: Tracks project lifecycle (PLANNING, ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- **TimeSheetStatus**: Tracks timesheet workflow (DRAFT, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- **ApprovalStatus**: Tracks approval decisions (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)

This design supports the complete timesheet management workflow from employee time tracking to managerial approval, with proper role-based access control and organizational structure management.
