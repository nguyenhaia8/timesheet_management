## 1. Problem Description

Organizations often face challenges in tracking employee work hours, managing projects, and approving timesheets. Manual processes lead to errors, delays, and lack of transparency, affecting payroll accuracy, project monitoring, and overall productivity.
Managers often spend more time chasing employees for submissions and checking hours than focusing on important decisions. Meanwhile, employees deal with unclear and inconsistent processes for submitting and updating their timesheets.

Our Timesheet Management System addresses these problems by offering a single, easy-to-use platform where projects can be registered, clients and departments managed, timesheets recorded, and approvals handled quickly. This helps reduce errors, save time, and give everyone a clear view of work progress.

## 2. User Stories

Describe the system from the user's perspective using user stories:

- As an **[Admin]**, I want to **[register a new project]** so that it can be assigned to employees and tracked for timesheet purposes.

- As a **[Admin]**, I want to **[add client details]** so that projects can be linked to the correct client.

- As an **[Admin]**, I want to **[add a new department]** so that employees can be grouped and managed effectively.

- As a **[Employee]**, I want to  **[create a my account]** so that I  can log in and use the system.

- As a **[Admin, Manager, or Employee]**, I want to  **[create, edit,  update and submit my timesheet]** so that work hours and tasks are accurately recorded.

- As a **[Manager]**, I want to  **[review and approve submitted timesheets]** so that only verified work hours are recorded for payroll and reporting.

## 3. Architecture of Project

### 3.1 Overview

Our system follows a **4-layer N-tier architecture** using modern Java Spring Boot practices:

1. **Presentation Layer (Controller)**  
   - Exposes RESTful APIs for all business entities (Employee, Department, Project, Task, Timesheet, Approval, etc.).
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses, input validation, and error handling.
   - Example: `EmployeeController`, `TimeSheetController`, etc.

2. **Service Layer**  
   - Contains business logic and orchestrates data flow between controllers and repositories.
   - Handles validation, calculations (e.g., total work hours), and business rules.
   - Example: `EmployeeServiceImpl`, `TimeSheetServiceImpl`, etc.

3. **Data Access Layer (Repository/DAO)**  
   - Uses Spring Data JPA repositories to abstract and manage all database operations.
   - Provides CRUD and custom query methods for each entity.
   - Example: `EmployeeRepository`, `TimeSheetRepository`, etc.

4. **Database Layer**  
   - MySQL database stores all persistent data, including employees, timesheets, tasks, approvals, and more.
   - Enforces referential integrity and supports transactional operations.

This separation ensures modularity, testability, and maintainability.
